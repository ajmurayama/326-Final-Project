# 326-Final-Project
This repository contains interelated python files which all contribute to a program that can add, delete, or edit data stored in a database relating to contact/address information. the file gui.py contains a python file which creates a GUI application and a database file to store input from the GUI application. The graphical user interface can take in information such as first name, last name, title, email, and phonenumber, then store all this information into the database created. The other python files use OOP to create objects of software (in the form of classes with methods) to take add, delete, or edit contact information automatically through the command line. 


Challenges with this program have mostly stemmed from the following: using correct syntax for desired namespace or path of the database file being created, syntax and decision on the required command line arguments for the scripts related to delete, adding, and editing to the database, and using sqlite3 such that the database does not lock when info is added to it.
